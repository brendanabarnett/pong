# Python Pong Game

Pong is a classic two-player game where each player controls a paddle to prevent a ball from passing their side, attempting to score by hitting the ball past their opponent. This Python (Turtle) implementation is a simple base from which I will implement some cool machine learning features soon.

### Controls
- **Left Player** Q (Up), A (Down)
- **Right Player** Up Arrow (Up), Down Arrow (Down)

### How to Play
1. Run the code in a Python environment that supports Turtle graphics
2. Find a friend to play with (hardest step ðŸ˜¢)
3. Use the designated keys to move the paddles, hit the ball, and score!

### Features
- **Ball Speed Increase:** The ball speeds up with each successful hit by a paddle
- **Boundary Controls:** Paddles have limits within the game borders
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of scores for both players

### Next Steps
- **Single Player Mode:** Implement a single-person mode with three difficulty levels
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Construct a continuous-learning machine learning model opponent for single players, providing dynamic and challenging gameplay
- **AI vs. AI:** Create various machine learning models and enable them to play against each other, showcasing different strategies and learning techniques
- **Code Optimization:** Optimize the existing code for enhanced performance, readability, and maintainability
